# Quantifying effectiveness of team recommendation for collaborative software development

## Running Experiment
Since this research was broken down into many sections, the instruction for running/compile/execute on each section will be written in __README.md__ on each folder of each part.

The order for running the code are as follows:
1. [Data Collection](DataCollection/)
2. Data Preparation
   - [Data Cleaning & Preprocessing](DataPreparation/)
   - [Sentiment Analysis](SentimentAnalysis/)
   - [Topic Modeling](TopicModel/)
3. [Network Generation](NetworkGeneration/)
4. [Feature enginering](FeatureExtraction/)
5. [Team Scoring Model Selection](ModelSelection/)
6. [Team Recommendation](TeamRecommendation/)
7. Evaluation
   - [P, R, F1, MRR](Evaluation/)
   - [STEM Calculation](STEMCalculation/) 

## Support
